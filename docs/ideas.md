# Ideas and TODO

Unfiltered ideas for later:

- User Sessions

- Unit Tests

- Time filters for crossings (will need to deal with timezones)

Do before final demo:

- Improve error handling and form validation

- Navbar button highlighting to show what page the user is on

- Improve UI so use cases are more obvious (text/hints)

- Give each page a header title for the browser tab

- Bring back dark mode with visibility improvements
